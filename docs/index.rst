Want to use reducer in a class?
-------------------------------

Want to use reducer in a class and need some help getting started/advice on
use? There is a *very* brief summary of how I've used with undergraduates at
:ref:`use_with_students`.

**Please contact me** at `mattwcraig@gmail.com
<mailto:mattwcraig@gmail.com?subject=Reducer>`_ or open an issue on the
`GitHub site for reducer`_ if you have questions, run into problems, or want
to let me know how you are using it!


Short walkthrough video
-----------------------

The YouTube video below has a walkthrough of the reducer notebook. No
explanatory audio or text, check out the :ref:`quickstart` for that.
